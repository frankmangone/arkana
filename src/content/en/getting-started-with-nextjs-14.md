# Getting Started with Next.js 14

_Published on November 15, 2023_

## Introduction

Next.js 14 brings several exciting new features and improvements to the framework. This post will guide you through the basics of getting started with the latest version.

### Key Features

- **Server Components**: Write React components that run on the server
- **Improved Routing**: The new App Router provides a more intuitive way to structure your application
- **Server Actions**: Perform mutations directly from your React components
- **Turbopack**: A Rust-based bundler for faster development experience

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a Server Component in Next.js 14:

```jsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function HomePage() {
  const data = await fetchData(); // This runs on the server!

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js 14 Site</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Setting Up a Project

1. Create a new project using:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
   ```

2. Navigate to your project folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-next-app
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
